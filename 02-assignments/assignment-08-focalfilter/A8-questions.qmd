In class, we have used a focal filter to smooth out the zones assignment for our field.  

Now, you are asked to play around with the focal filter arguments of **matrix size** and **summary function type**, and answer questions based on the results.  

## Instructions and questions 
Add your first and last name to the `author` field on the YAML.  

1. Go back to the focal window chunk and play with it by testing the following combinations:  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of mean  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of minimum  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of max  

For each of these three new scenarios, create a map with the result making sure the map title (tip: in function `labs()`) reflects the matrix size and function type, and export this plot to your "output" folder in a .png format, following the name scheme of zonesmoothed_matrixsize_function (e.g., zonesmoothed_5x5_mean.png for the settings used in class). 

::: {.callout-warning}

You do NOT need to code in this script. All the code to run the focal window, create and export maps should be done in your class script. Here, we are just embedding the figures you created from the class script.

2. Embed below the zone maps for:  
- Before smoothing (done in class)  
- Matrix 5 x 5, smooth function of mean (done in class)
- Each of the three scenarios ran above

After embedding all maps above, answer the following questions:  

3. Describe what happened visually on the map when you changed the matrix size from 5x5 to 3x3 while using the same function (i.e., mean). 

4. Describe what happened visually on the map when you changed the function from mean to min, and from mean to max with the matrix size of 3x3.   

5. Among all the four focal filters we tried, which one would you recommend to be used for this field? Why?

After answering all questions, rename this file by adding your first and last name to the end (e.g. A8-questions-Leo Bastos.qmd), render it, and send the .html to **lmbastos@uga.edu** by **Monday, April 12th 11:59 pm**.
