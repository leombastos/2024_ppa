# 1) Setup  

```{r Setup, message=F}
# Loading packages (every time you open R)
library(readxl) # to read excel files
library(janitor) # to clean data
library(dplyr) # wrangling
library(tidyr) # wrangling
library(readr) # to export csv

```


```{r Reading data}

This study was conducted at four different locations in one year to assess the effect of potassium (K) fertilizer rates on soybean trifoliate K concentration at growth stage R4.  

Each study was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with K rate as the only treatment factor with levels 0, 50, 100, and 150 lbs K2O/ac.

# 2) Data wrangling  
```{r soyk_1 - clean_names()}
soyk_1

```


```{r soyk_2 - filter()}
names(soyk_1)

soyk_2 

soyk_2
```

```{r soyk_3 - mutate()}
# Transforming K rate from lbs/ac to kg/ha
soyk_3

```

```{r soyk_4 - case_when()}
soyk_4 

soyk_4

```

```{r soyk_5 - pivot_longer()}

```

```{r soyk_6 - separate()}
soyk_6

View(soyk_6)
```

```{r soyk_7 - select()}
names(soyk_6)

soyk_7

```

```{r soyk_8 - arrange()}
soyk_8 

soyk_8
```

```{r soyk_9 and 10 - group_by and summarise}
# group_by
soyk_9 

soyk_9

class(soyk_8)

class(soyk_9)

# summarise
soyk_10 

soyk_10
```

```{r Piping it all together}
soyk_w 

soyk_w


```

```{r Checking if same as without pipe}
# Same result?
identical(soyk_7, soyk_w)

```

```{r Saving to file for further analysis}


```

# 3) Assignment   
Starting from soyk, use data wrangling functions in a pipe workflow to generate the average k_pct for each K rate (in kg/ha) within each location (basically, averaging over reps). You can use the chunk below to complete this quiz.

```{r assignment}
soyk 
```


Tip: the final data frame will have 16 rows.

Submit your result (copy the table from the chunk output, paste it in the email body) to me by email (lmbastos@uga.edu) by Tuesday Jan 17th 11:59 pm.
