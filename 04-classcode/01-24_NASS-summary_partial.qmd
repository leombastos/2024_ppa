# Introduction  
This report was developed to explore, through **tables and plots**, USDA NASS data for **soybeans production at the county level for all years available**.  

The raw data was downloaded from [USDA NASS QuickStats portal](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov).  

# Setup  
## Loading packages  
```{r }
#install.packages('dlookr')

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dlookr)
library(janitor)
library(ggthemes)

```

## Importing data  
```{r soy}
soy <- read_csv("")
```

# EDA  
## Print `soy`  
```{r}
soy
```

## `soy` summary  
```{r }
summary(soy)
```

## Exploring column classes and distinct cases  
```{r }
soy
```

```{r}
soy 
```

# Wrangling  
```{r soy_w}
soy_w <- soy %>%
  clean_names() 
  # Keeping only survey data 

  # Selecting desired variables

  # Replacing (D) for NA in prod_bu

  # Removing , from prod_bu

  # Transforming prod_bu from character to numeric

  # Transforming production from bu to million bu

soy_w
```

# EDA round 2  
## Plot production distribution  

```{r }
ggplot(soy_w, aes(x = prod_mibu))

```
Where does most of the production is distributed (eye-ball where the peak of the plot above is on the x-axis)?  

## Plot production distribution by year  

```{r }

```
On same year, some counties produced near zero while others producer a lot more (~ 1 million bushels).   

## Plot production distribution by year and county  
```{r }
ggplot(soy_w, aes(x = year,
                  y = prod_mibu,
                  color = county
))

```
Kind of messy to make sense, too many lines (one for each county).    

## Table with highest production  

What was the highest production record of any county across all years? When did it happen and which county reported it?  

```{r }


```

## Table with lowest production   
What was the lowest production record of any county across all years? When did it happen and which county reported it?  


```{r }


```
At an average yield of 50 bu/ac, Glascock county would've only needed 1 field of 10 ac to make this cut. That's really not much at all.  

## Plot the average county production for each year  
```{r }
soy_w 

```

## What was the latest year reported?  
```{r}
soy_w 

```

## What was the highest production in 2022?  
```{r}
soy_w 

```

## Plot production over time for the highest producing county in 2022  

```{r}
soy_w 

```

## What was the lowest production in 2022?  
```{r}
soy_w %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  arrange(prod_mibu)
```

## Plot production over time for the lowest producing county in 2022  

```{r}
soy_w 

```

## Plot production over time for both of these counties above  
```{r}
soy_w 


```
## Plot the state total production on each year 
```{r }
soy_w 

```
## Final: make the plot above publication-ready  

```{r }



```
