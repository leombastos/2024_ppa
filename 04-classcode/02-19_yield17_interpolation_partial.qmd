# Learning Objectives  
Today, our learning objectives are:  
- To learn about why is interpolation needed and useful  
- Explore one type of interpolation analysis (inverse distance weighted - IDW)  
- Perform IDW on the yield data sets  
- Extract interpolated yield data based on a grid and save to file  


# Setup  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#install.packages("gstat")
#install.packages("stars")
#install.packages("cubelyr")

# Packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(gstat)
library(raster)
library(stars)

```

```{r reading yield data}
yield17_c 

yield17_c
```

```{r summary}
summary(yield17_c)
```


```{r boundary, echo=F}
boundary_w 

boundary_w
```

# Interpolation  
Why do we need to interpolate?  

```{r yield clean map}
yieldclean_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = yield17_c,
          aes(color=yield_lbac), size=.1)+
  scale_color_viridis()+
  geom_sf(data = boundary_w,
          fill=NA,
          color="blue")

yieldclean_map
```

Interpolation methods:  
  - deterministic: ex. **inverse distance weight (IDW)**  
  - statistical: ex. kriging  

For simplicity sake, we are going to use IDW for this exercise.  

## Grid
```{r grid_v}
# grid in vector format
grid_v  

grid_v

class(grid_v)
```

```{r grid vector plot}
yieldclean_map

```

One issue here is that interpolation methods in R do not accept grids in vector format, only in **raster** format.  

Let's rasterize our vector grid.  

```{r grid_r}
# grid in raster format 
grid_r 

grid_r

class(grid_r)
```

```{r grid_r plot}
yieldclean_map
```

## IDW  
Let's set up the IDW algorithm by providing a formula. Here, we are just setting up the model.    
```{r idw_mod}
idw_mod 

idw_mod

class(idw_mod)
```

Now, we need to actually predict our IDW model on our raster grid (this is where the interpolation really happens).  
```{r idw_pred}
idw_pred 

idw_pred

class(idw_pred)
```

```{r idw_pred plot}
ggplot()

```

# Grid extraction  
In this step, the goal is to extract the interpolated yield value from the raster and basically transform it from cell (raster) to a polygon (vector).  

```{r idw_pred_v}
idw_pred_v 

idw_pred_v

class(idw_pred_v)
```

```{r idw_pred_v plot}

```

```{r interpolated distribution}


```

# Exporting to file  

Since we will use this product in a future class (to look into yield stability and create management zones), let's export it to file.  

```{r exporting}

```
