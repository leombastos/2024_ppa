# Learning Objectives  
Today, our learning objectives are to:  

- Import **interpolated cleaned yield data** for 3 years  
- Create year-specific spatial yield stability areas  
- Create spatio-temporal yield stability areas  
- Export the final yield stability layer  

# Setup  
```{r setup }
# Packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(ggthemes)
library(tibble)
```

## Data import
```{r yieldic17}
yieldic17 

yieldic17

summary(yieldic17)
```


```{r yieldic19}
yieldic19 

summary(yieldic19)
```
```{r yieldic20}
yieldic20 
yieldic20

summary(yieldic20)
```
> What year was the highest yielding?  
> What about the lowest yielding?  

> Same number of observations for all layers?  
> Why is that?  

# Spatial stability  
Every time we deal with yield data across various years/fields/crops, there are challenges:  

- If different years/fields/crops, how to compare?  
- Even if same field but different years/crops, how to compare?  

Some solutions:  

- Standardize by mean/median/max (numerical). Ex. field mean in a given year was 1500 lb/ac, so divide all other yield values from that year by 1500.  

- Standardize by quantile (categorical). Ex. field median (e.g., 50% quantile) was 2000 lb/ac, so all observations below 2000 are classified as "low", and all above 2000 are classified as "high" for that year.  

**In our case, we are using the numerical approach.**
First let's calculate median yield per year, and then divide all yield observations for that year by that year's median.

Beginning with 2017 yield data.
```{r sy_17}
sy_17 

sy_17
```
Let's check how does this standardization looks like in space.  

```{r sy_17 map}
sy_17_map 


sy_17_map 
```
Repeat the same steps for 2019.  

```{r sy_19}
sy_19 

sy_19
```

```{r sy_19 map}
sy_19_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = sy_19,
          aes(fill = sy19), 
          color = NA)+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#440154FF",
                       mid = "white",
                       high = "#22A884FF",
                       midpoint = 100,
                       breaks = seq(0,180,20)
  )+
  labs(title="2019")+
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


sy_19_map 
```
Repeat the same steps for 2020.  

```{r sy_20}
sy_20  

sy_20
```

```{r sy_20 map}
sy_20_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = sy_20,
          aes(fill = sy20), 
          color = NA)+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#440154FF",
                       mid = "white",
                       high = "#22A884FF",
                       midpoint = 100,
                       breaks = seq(0,180,20)
  )+
  labs(title = "2020")+
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

sy_20_map 
```
Let's plot all 3 maps side-by-side to assist in visualizing them.  

```{r all maps}
library(patchwork)
sy_17_map + sy_19_map + sy_20_map +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect")

ggsave("../output/spatialstability.png",
       width = 7, height = 3.5)

```
```{r}
summary(sy_17$sy17) #25 to 160
summary(sy_19$sy19) #6 to 161
summary(sy_20$sy20) #36 to 161
```

# Spatio-temporal stability  
To perform a temporal analysis, we need to merge all three data frames into one.  

After joining the data sets, we still only have their information on year-specific yield spatial standardization. 

> How can we merge these pieces of information to create a spatial-temporal classification?  

We can use the yield mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of each pixel over 3 years, and use that to guide our decision.    

First, let's merge the 3 data sets and calculate pixel-based mean and cv.

## Pixel-based mean and cv  
```{r}
sy_all 

sy_all

```

## EDA on pixel-based stats  
Summary:  
```{r summary }
summary(sy_all$cv_pixel)
```

Density plot:
```{r density plot }


```

Standardized mean map
```{r mean map}
sy_all_mean 

sy_all_mean
```

Standardized mean cv map  
```{r cv map}
sy_all_cv 

sy_all_cv

```

```{r both maps}
sy_all_mean + sy_all_cv

ggsave("../output/sy-temp-stability.png",
       width = 6, height = 4)

```

# Classification  

Here's how I want to classify our spatial-temporal classes:  

- If a pixel has CV > 30%, then it is classified as "unstable"  

- If a pixel has CV < 30%, and mean standardized yield > 120%, then it is classified as "high-stable"  

- If a pixel has CV < 30%, and mean standardized yield > 80% and < 120%, then it is classified as "medium-stable" 

- If a pixel has CV < 30%, and mean standardized yield < 80%, then it is classified as "low-stable" 

Let's apply these rules below:  

```{r}
sy_all_class 

sy_all_class 
```

Now, let's plot the classes.  
```{r}

```


> Just eyeballing, what is the major stability class? And the minor?  

# Classes proportion  
Let's calculate below:  
```{r proportion per stability zone}


```

# Exporting  
Let's export this data set so we can use it again in a future exercise.  
```{r exporting yield stability}

```

# Summary  

Today we:  

- Imported all three interpolated cleaned yield data  
- Standardized each year-specific yield pixel by dividing it by the year median (spatial stability)  
- Joined the three data sets, calculated pixel-based CV, and classified each pixel as stable high, stable low, or unstable based on pixel standardized yield and CV (spatial-temporal stability)  
- Exported the spatial-temporal stability layer
