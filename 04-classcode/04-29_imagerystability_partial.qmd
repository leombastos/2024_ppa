# Introduction  
At this point, we have downloaded growing-season imagery for one field for 3 years.  

For each year, we have extracted, on a pixel basis, the median GNDVI value. Those maps could be related to and represent yield potential areas (i.e., areas with higher growing-season median values have greater yield potential than areas with lower median values).  

What if we used this information to generate a yield spatial-temporal variability analysis?  

The goals of this exercise are to:  
  - Create spatial-temporal yield stability classes based on year-specific median GNDVI values.  
  - Compare the GNDVI-based vs. yield-based spatial stability maps  
  

# Setup  
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(stars)
library(ggthemes)
library(mapview)

```

```{r}
pixels_17 

pixels_17
```

```{r}
pixels_19 

pixels_19
```

```{r}
pixels_20 

pixels_20
```

# Wrangling  
```{r}
pixels_all <- pixels_19 %>%
  st_join(pixels_17,
          join = st_equals,
          left = T) %>%
  st_join(pixels_20,
          join = st_equals,
          left = T)

pixels_all
```

# Spatial-temporal stability analysis  


```{r pixel_stab}
pixel_stab 

pixel_stab %>%
  summary
```


```{r pixel_stab_class}
pixel_stab_class <- pixel_stab %>%
  mutate(stclass = case_when(
    cv > ...  ~ "unstable",
    cv < ...  & mean < ...  ~ "low-stable",
    cv < ...  & mean > ...  & mean < ... ~ "medium-stable",
    cv < ...  & mean > ...  ~ "high-stable"
  ))


pixel_stab_class %>%
  group_by(stclass) %>%
  tally()
```

# Plots  
```{r mean std}
ggplot(data = pixel_stab_class) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ...,
              color = ...
  ), size = 1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = "transparent") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(na.value = "transparent") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

```{r cv std}
ggplot(data = pixel_stab_class)+
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ...,
              color = ...
              ), size = 1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = "transparent") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(na.value = "transparent") +
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

```{r stclass}
ggplot(data = pixel_stab_class)+
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ...,
              color = ...
  ), size = 1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "C") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "C") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```
How does it compare to yield stability classes?

Please take 5 min to respond to the TEVAL.  
Your feedback is really important for me to know what worked, what didn't, and improve for next time.  

Thanks!
